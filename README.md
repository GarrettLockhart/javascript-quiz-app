<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I built this only using JavaScript, HTML & CSS from scratch, it will keep track of your score and store that so even in the event of a page refresh or you close and open, you score will remain. If you get the wrong answers the time will deduct 20 second for every wrong answer. It utilizes arrays to store the question, possible answers and correct answers. I learned a lot with project including DOM manipulation, looping through arrays only when an event had ocurred, long story short, it was rad!

### Built With

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
